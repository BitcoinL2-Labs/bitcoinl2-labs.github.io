# Hypernative Activates Ecosystem-Wide Protection for Stacks: Bitcoin’s Leading L2

We're excited to announce a new partnership with Hypernative, the industry leader in real-time threat detection and response for Web3. This collaboration will fortify applications built on the Stacks layer by offering real-time security monitoring and automatic exploit prevention tooling. 

Bitcoiners understand the paramount importance of security and building for the long haul. Stacks, the leading Bitcoin L2, is unlocking Bitcoin's $1 trillion in passive capital, transforming it into a fully programmable, productive asset. With the upcoming 2024 Nakamoto release, Stacks is poised to adopt faster speeds and bring Bitcoin-level transaction finality to smart contracts. It’s an exciting time for the whole ecosystem, and with more eyes on Stacks projects, security is all the more important.

Gal Sagie, co-founder and CEO of Hypernative, shares this vision: 
> "Stacks is on a mission to scale Bitcoin and make more advanced financial constructs like decentralized finance possible on the network. With more code and more smart contracts comes a critical need to make sure they are safe. Hypernative is proud to secure the entire Stacks ecosystem in real-time and help activate the Bitcoin economy."

## Bringing Bitcoin-Grade Security to Stacks Apps

In line with the Bitcoin ethos of robust security, projects building on Stacks will now have access to Hypernative's cutting-edge platform. This integration will provide:
- Real-time security monitoring and prevention
- Incident response and root cause analysis
- Assistance in fund recovery leveraging Hypernative's network

The scope of protection extends across multiple fronts including:
- Security and compliance
- Threat intelligence
- Financial and market risks
- Operational and governance risks
- Phishing scams and fraud prevention

### Enhancing Protocol Security: The Bitcoin Way

Hypernative introduces ecosystem-wide monitoring covering a broad range of attack surfaces and risk vectors including:
- Bridges and internal infrastructure
- Smart contracts
- Multisig wallets
- Treasury and token allocations

### Smart Contracts, Smarter Security

Hypernative's platform monitors both onchain and offchain data sources in real-time, identifying over 200 risk types with unparalleled accuracy. Using sophisticated machine learning models, heuristics, simulations, and graph-based detections, Hypernative provides the fastest and most reliable threat detection in Web3. Their impressive track record speaks for itself:
- 99.5% of hacks detected last year
- Less than 0.001% false positive rate
- Over $50 million in funds saved to date

By combining Bitcoin's rock-solid foundation with Stacks' programmability and Hypernative's state-of-the-art security, Stacks applications can create unique offerings for Bitcoiners.

Stay tuned for more updates as the broader ecosystem continues its mission to make Bitcoin not just a store of value, but a powerhouse of decentralized applications and financial innovation – all secured with the robustness that Bitcoiners expect and deserve.
